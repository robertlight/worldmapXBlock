   The following is a way of defining what type of answer the map should require the student to give during an assessment.
   It defines not only what type of input is being elicited (a point-click, a polygon, a polyline) but how to evaluate
   whether or not that input is correct or not.

<!--
   percentAnswerInsidePaddedGeometry is the amount of the answer geometry which must be inside the padded target geometry
       - a single "point" (click) should be 100% inside the target geometry since it has no area.
   percentGeometryInsidePaddedAnswer is the amount of the target geometry which is inside the padded answer geometry
       - again, a single "point" (click) should be 100% inside the target geometry since it has no area.
